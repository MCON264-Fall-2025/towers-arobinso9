/**
 * Towers of Hanoi (Recursive).
 *
 * PROBLEM:
 * - Move a stack of n disks from peg 'from' to peg 'to' using peg 'aux',
 *   moving one disk at a time and never placing a larger disk on a smaller disk.
 *
 * RECURSION DESIGN:
 * - Base case:
 *     * n == 0 -> nothing to do (return).
 * - Recursive idea for n >= 1:
 *     1) Move n-1 disks from 'from' to 'aux' (using 'to' as auxiliary).
 *     2) Move the largest disk (disk n) from 'from' to 'to'.
 *     3) Move n-1 disks from 'aux' to 'to' (using 'from' as auxiliary).
 *
 * COMPLEXITY:
 * - Moves: 2^n - 1
 * - Time: O(2^n)
 * - Space: O(n) recursion depth
 *
 * SUGGESTION:
 * - Collect moves in a List<String> like "A -> C" so tests can assert the exact sequence.
